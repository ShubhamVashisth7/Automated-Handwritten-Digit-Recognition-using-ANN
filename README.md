# Handwritten-Digit-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
This is more of a "HELLO WORLD" program in the feild of Deep Learning. As I have used an already pre-processed sample MNIST data. Using Keras I was able to design a simple Artificial Neural Net to achieve an accuracy of greater than 96%.
Language used: Python 3
Library used: Keras, Matplotlib and Numpy
